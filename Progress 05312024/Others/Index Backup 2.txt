                        Lisa Tzwu-Fang Su, born in November 1969 in Tainan, 
                        Taiwan, immigrated to the United States at age 3. 
                        Raised in a family that emphasized math and science, 
                        she developed an early interest in engineering. 
                        Su attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York 
                        City and then pursued electrical engineering at the 
                        Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).<br> <br>
                        During her undergraduate years, she worked on semiconductor 
                        research projects and interned at Analog Devices, sparking 
                        her interest in the field. She earned her bachelor's and 
                        master's degrees from MIT, followed by a PhD in electrical 
                        engineering, focusing on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) 
                        technology to enhance transistor efficiency. Su's thesis 
                        was titled "Extreme-submicrometer silicon-on-insulator 
                        (SOI) MOSFETs."

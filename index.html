                        Lisa Tzwu-Fang Su, born in November 1969 in Tainan, 
                        Taiwan, immigrated to the United States at age 3. 
                        Raised in a family that emphasized math and science, 
                        she developed an early interest in engineering. 
                        Su attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York 
                        City and then pursued electrical engineering at the 
                        Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).<br> <br>
                        During her undergraduate years, she worked on semiconductor 
                        research projects and interned at Analog Devices, sparking 
                        her interest in the field. She earned her bachelor's and 
                        master's degrees from MIT, followed by a PhD in electrical 
                        engineering, focusing on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) 
                        technology to enhance transistor efficiency. Su's thesis 
                        was titled "Extreme-submicrometer silicon-on-insulator 
                        (SOI) MOSFETs."

                            Beginning her professional journey at IBM, Su held 
                            various technical and business roles over 13 years, 
                            contributing significantly to cutting-edge technologies. 
                            In 2012, she joined Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), quickly 
                            rising to become President and CEO in 2014. Su's leadership 
                            at AMD led to a remarkable resurgence, marked by innovative 
                            strategies and product development, notably the Ryzen 
                            processors.

                            <br>

                            Su has served on the boards of Analog Devices, Cisco Systems, Inc., 
                            the Global Semiconductor Alliance, and the U.S. Semiconductor 
                            Industry Association. As of 2016 she has published over forty 
                            technical articles and coauthored a book chapter discussing 
                            next-generation consumer electronics.
